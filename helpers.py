            to be eligible to write the university exams.
            The criteria for attendance are:

            3. AETCOM - 75 %.

            So, a general rule of thumb is that a score of 50% or higher in each assessment is good.
            I will now tell you the attendance and scores of a particular student. 
            The attendances I provide will be a snapshot of 
            the current state and more classes may be taken, so an ineligibility can be recovered from.
            If there are no more classes, remedial classes will be conducted.
            I will provide the scores of assessments already conducted. 
            {assessments_status}.
            The student's attendance in percentages are - theory : {theory_attendance} , 
            practical : {practical_attendance} , AETCOM : {aetcom_attendance}. 
            {scores_part_of_query}.
            I want you to provide the student with
            feedback and insights or recommendations based on his performance. If possible, include comments
            on the trend in his performance over the terms (an assessment will have the term number after 
            its name if it is conducted multiple times).
            I want you to provide encouragement, feedback or caution to the student as is appropriate. 
            Please phrase your answer as though you are directly addressing the student. 
            Please do not include a greeting at the beginning or sign anything at the end. 
            Keep it a little informal. Keep the word limit of your response strictly between {word_limit} words. '''
